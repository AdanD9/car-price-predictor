[OFFER]
A centralized prompt management platform (SaaS) that transforms scattered AI prompts into an organized, searchable, and shareable knowledge base - think "GitHub for prompts" where users can version, collaborate, and monetize their best AI interactions.


[OFFER PRICING]
The app costs $10/mo for the base plan, up to $25/mo for power features like AI prompt enhancements


[AUDIENCE]
* Primary: Power users of AI tools (developers, content creators, researchers) who use prompts daily
* Secondary: Teams collaborating on AI projects who need standardized prompts
* Tertiary: Prompt engineers looking to monetize their expertise


[PROBLEM]
AI users repeatedly lose valuable prompts across multiple platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Midjourney, etc.), struggle to find and reuse their best work, and lack ways to collaborate or learn from others' proven prompts. This leads to duplicated effort, inconsistent results, and missed opportunities for knowledge sharing.




[OFFER DETAILS]
Here’s the feature list of the app:
Prompt Organization
* Create folder/tag hierarchy for organization
   * Nested folders with drag-and-drop
   * Multiple tags per prompt
   * Smart collections based on rules
* Search across all prompts with filters
   * Full-text search
   * Filter by platform, date, tags, author
   * Search within results
